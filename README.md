## Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Concepts

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging it to a reserve asset, such as a fiat currency like the US Dollar or a commodity like gold. This stability makes stablecoins an attractive option for transactions, savings, and as a store of value, addressing the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. They are commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications for lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.
